NAME
       find - search for files in a directory hierarchy

SYNOPSIS
       find [-H] [-L] [-P] [-D debugopts] [-Olevel] [starting-point...] [expression]

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of find.  GNU find searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according
       to the rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for and operations, true for or), at which point find moves on  to  the  next  file
       name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If  you  are  using  find in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it to search directories that are writable by other users), you should read the `Security
       Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is called Finding Files and comes with findutils.   That document also includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual
       page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

OPTIONS
       The  -H, -L and -P options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are taken to be names of files or directories to be examined, up to the first argu‐
       ment that begins with `-', or the argument `(' or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression describing what is to be searched for.  If no paths are given,
       the current directory is used.  If no expression is given, the expression -print is used (but you should probably consider using -print0 instead, anyway).

       This  manual  page  talks  about  `options'  within  the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of find but are specified immediately after the last path name.  The five `real'
       options -H, -L, -P, -D and -O must appear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash -- can also be used to signal that any remaining arguments are  not  options  (though  ensuring
       that all start points begin with either `./' or `/' is generally safer if you use wildcards in the list of start points).

       -P     Never follow symbolic links.  This is the default behaviour.  When find examines or prints information a file, and the file is a symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from
              the properties of the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow symbolic links.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of the file to which the link points, not from the
              link  itself (unless it is a broken symbolic link or find is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this option implies -noleaf.  If you later use the -P option,
              -noleaf will still be in effect.  If -L is in effect and find discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to by the symbolic  link  will  be
              searched.

              When the -L option is in effect, the -type predicate will always match against the type of the file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link
              is broken).  Actions that can cause symbolic links to become broken while find is executing (for example -delete) can give rise to confusing behaviour.  Using -L causes the -lname  and
              -ilname predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do  not  follow  symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When find examines or prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the
              properties of the symbolic link itself.   The only exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For  that
              situation,  the  information  used  is  taken from whatever the link points to (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link itself is used as a fallback if the file
              pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If -H is in effect and one of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to  a  directory,  the  contents  of  that
              directory will be examined (though of course -maxdepth 0 would prevent this).

       If  more  than one of -H, -L and -P is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command line takes effect.  Since it is the default, the -P option should be consid‐
       ered to be in effect unless either -H or -L is specified.

       GNU find frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself, before any searching has begun.  These options also affect how those arguments are processed.   Specifically,
       there  are  a  number  of tests that compare files listed on the command line against a file we are currently considering.  In each case, the file specified on the command line will have been
       examined and some of its properties will have been saved.  If the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the -P option is in effect (or if neither -H nor -L were specified), the  informa‐
       tion  used  for  the comparison will be taken from the properties of the symbolic link.  Otherwise, it will be taken from the properties of the file the link points to.  If find cannot follow
       the link (for example because it has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the link itself will be used.

       When the -H or -L options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as the argument of -newer will be dereferenced, and the timestamp will be taken from the file to  which  the  symbolic  link
